If Unity crash, it can be a problem with the DLL memory or an exception have occured inside. Refresh the DLL used (section Modify DLL Plugin cards_rgbtrack) and try again. If the problem persist, use instead the console in Debug mode (build the DLL also in Debug and sync it) in order to have more information about the problem.
